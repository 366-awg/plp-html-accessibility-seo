            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities are currently driving an unprecedented rate of change.</p>

        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), Deforestation (cutting down trees), Industrial emissions, Vehicle emissions, Agricultural activities (like livestock releasing methane), Waste in landfills (releases greenhouse gases), Overuse of energy from non-renewable sources</p>
        </section>

        <section id="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change leads to rising temperatures, unpredictable weather, droughts, floods, and melting ice. It harms animals, plants, and people by affecting food, water, and health. It also increases natural disasters and makes life harder, especially for the poor.</p>

        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions to Climate Change</h2>
            <p>We can fight climate change by planting trees, using clean energy like solar and wind, saving electricity, and recycling. Walking or using public transport instead of cars helps too. Governments and people must work together to protect our planet for the future.</p>
